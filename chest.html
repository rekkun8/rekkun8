        <h1>3 Best Chest Exercises</h1>
        <p>
        <h2>dips</h2>
        <p> Why: Unlike the humble press-up (which we’ll get to soon enough) dips require you to lift the entirety of
            your bodyweight from the ground. More resistance = more growth, even with bodyweight movements.
        </p>
        How: Jump up on two parallel bars or gymnastics rings with your palms facing inward and your arms straight — use
        two boxes or the backs of two sturdy chairs if you’re at home. Bend your arms and slowly lower your body until
        your elbows are at right angles, ensuring they don’t flare outward. Drive yourself back up to the top, squeezing
        your chest and arms hard, before repeating.</p>
        <p>
        <h2>feet elevated press-up</h2>
        <p> Why: Elevating your feet slightly (or more than slightly) when performing press-ups alters the angle against
            you, providing more resistance and greater gains. You’ll also emphasise parts of your chest that can be
            missed with flat pressing.
        </p>
        How: Kick both feet up onto a box or bench. Create a strong plank position with your hands on the ground,
        shoulder-width apart. Slowly lower your chest to the ground, before explosively pressing back to lockout. The
        higher your feet, the greater the resistance, but the more you’ll emphasise your shoulder muscles.</p>
        <p>
        <h2>deficit press-up</h2>
        <p> Why: The key to growth is stimulating your muscles through a full range of motion. By raising your hands up
            on handles or boxes either side of your body, you’re able to drop yourself below your hands, stretching your
            chest fully and targeting more muscle fibres.
        </p>
        How: Assume a strong plank position, with your core tight and hands gripping a pair of handles, dumbbells or
        placed on two benches, either side of your body. Bend your elbows to bring your chest to the floor, feeling a
        deep stretch as you lower. Keep your elbows from flaring away from your body as you push back up explosively.
